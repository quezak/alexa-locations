How many times did you enter a shopping mall but couldn't find a toilet?
You then need to talk to people, it's terrible! As a fellow nerd I completely understand.
And so we've created an app for Alexa that shows you around the public spaces.
Our vision for the future is that instead of info centers, there will Alexas that you can ask for help, everywhere.
You're getting desperate? Ask "Alexa, where is the closest toilet from here".
In the long run this strategy will save a huge amount of money because companies will need to hire less people.
and what if you're lost?
"Alexa, open here; where am I?"
where is food?"
Looking for something more abstract? We got you covered
"Alexa, open here; where is god?"

Ok, now for some technical stuff:
We're obviously using lambda, python and alexa.
We also have an instance of DynamoDB with a graph of this faculty.
The biggest hurdle I see in the future is that the location needs to be mapped manually before our system can work.
On the other hand, since we often use a lot of synonyms and metaphors in daily life,
I'm proud of tag system that allows easy understanding of those by Alexa and has a very low technical cost.

In the end only one thing is constant though
"Alexa, how to get to rome from here"
